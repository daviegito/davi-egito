## Welcome to my world! 🌎

After graduating from Business Management, I've looked for new experiences and challenges on Software Engineering. I am eager to become a DevOps Engineer as simplifying workloads through Process Improvement has sparked my interest ever since my first graduation. I'm currently getting myself acquainted with DevOps concepts, like CI/CD, and main tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible and Jenkins.

- 🤓 I’m currently on my way towards learning Rust, StackOverflow's Protégée for some years now.
- I'm an [IEEE member](https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/app/p/daviegitocoelho) and I work on the Computer Society Student Chapter of my University 👨‍💻
- 🧠 Fun fact: I'm obsessed with Geography and I do know a fair amount of capital cities across the world. I've never claimed to be your average Joe guy 😉
